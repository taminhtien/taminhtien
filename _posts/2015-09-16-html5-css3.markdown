## Border Radius
The border-radius property applies rounded corners to borders.

```
border-radius: <top left> <top right> <bottom right> <bottom left>
```

Example:

```
.box {
  border-radius: 4px 15px 12px 10px;
}
```

You can also specify the border-radius value in percentages.

```
.box {
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```

## Box Shadow
The box-shadow property specifies a shadow on an element.

```
box-shadow: <inset> <offset-x> <offset-y> <blur-radius> <spread-radius> <color>
```

- inset: Optional. If it is not specified,  it will be set to default value is "drop shadow" rather than "inset shadown".
- offset-x: The shadow offset x value, which is going to move the shadow along x-axis to left or right. If offset-x is positive, move to right. Otherwise move to left.
- offset-y: The shadow offset y value, which is going to move the shadow along y-axis up or down. If offset-x is positive, move down. Otherwise move up.
- blur-radius: Optional. It alters the blur amount of the shadow, causing it to become bigger or lighter with a large value. Default is the size of the element.
- spread-radius: Optional. Causes the shadow to shrink or expand.
- color: The color of shadow.

```
box-shadow: 1px 2px 0 2px #000;
// inset is missing, so it will be set to default is drop shadow. 1px of offset-x, 2px of offset-y, 0px of blur-radius, 2px or spread-radius, #000 for the color of drop shadow.
box-shadow: 1px 2px 2px #000;
// blur-radius is 2px while spread radius is 0.
```
