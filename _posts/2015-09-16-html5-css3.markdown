# Overview & Update

# CSS3 Styles

## Border Radius

The border-radius property applies rounded corners to borders.

~~~ css
border-radius: <top left> <top right> <bottom right> <bottom left>
~~~

Example:

~~~
.box {
  border-radius: 4px 15px 12px 10px;
}
~~~

You can also specify the border-radius value in percentages.

~~~
.box {
  border-radius: 50%;
}
~~~

## Box Shadow
The box-shadow property specifies a shadow on an element.

~~~
box-shadow: <inset> <offset-x> <offset-y> <blur-radius> <spread-radius> <color>
~~~

- *inset:* Optional. If it is not specified,  it will be set to default value is "drop shadow" rather than "inset shadown".
- *offset-x:* The shadow offset x value, which is going to move the shadow along x-axis to left or right. If offset-x is positive, move to right. Otherwise move to left.
- *offset-y:* The shadow offset y value, which is going to move the shadow along y-axis up or down. If offset-x is positive, move down. Otherwise move up.
- *blur-radius:* Optional. It alters the blur amount of the shadow, causing it to become bigger or lighter with a large value. Default is the size of the element.
- *spread-radius:* Optional. Causes the shadow to shrink or expand.
- *color:* The color of shadow.

~~~
box-shadow: 1px 2px 0 2px #000;
// inset is missing, so it will be set to default is drop shadow. 1px of offset-x, 2px of offset-y, 0px of blur-radius, 2px or spread-radius, #000 for the color of drop shadow.
box-shadow: 1px 2px 2px #000;
// blur-radius is 2px while spread radius is 0.
~~~

Example of using inset:

~~~
box-shadow: inset 1px 2px 2px blue;
// inset is shadow which dropping into inside element
~~~

## Text Shadow
It is really similar to box-shadow but it applies the shadow to text, as the name implies.

~~~
text-shadow: <offset-x> <offset-y> <blur-radius> <color>
~~~

Example:

~~~
h1 {
  text-shadow: 1px 2px 2px blue;
}
~~~

## Box Sizing
Box sizing is used to change default CSS box model, which used to calculate widths and heights of given element.

**Box model:**

- Box model references the design and layout of given HTML elements.
- Each HTML element is a box consisting padding, borders, margins and its content.
- The box model refers to how these properties are calculated in conjuction with one another in order to set the element's dimensions.

**Box model refresher:** not include margins anymore because the margin isn't a part of the width.

Example:

~~~
.box {
	border: 2px solid black;
	margin: 20px;
	padding: 10px;
	width: 300px;
}
// => size of the box: 300 + 20 + 4 = 324
~~~

Three values of box-sizing:

- *content-box:* default value. The width and height are measured by including only the content, but not the border, margin, or padding.
- *padding-box:* include padding, not the border or margin.
- *border-box:* in clude padding, border, not the margin.

Example usage of padding-box:

~~~
.box {
	box-sizing: padding-box;
	border: 2px solid black;
	margin: 20px;
	padding: 10px;
	width: 300px; // included padding already, so the content is reduced to 280px
}
// => size of the box is 300(width) + 4(border) = 304
~~~

Example usage of border-box:	

~~~
.box {
	box-sizing: border-box;
	border: 2px solid black;
	margin: 20px;
	padding: 10px;
	width: 300px; // included padding and border already, so the content is reduced to 276px
}
// => size of the box is 300
