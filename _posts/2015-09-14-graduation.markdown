Although I don't care too much about what kind of the qualification but Good is really important to me :grin:.

I've been staying at home for a long time and I wanna seek a job in next month before the graduation. I don't wanna graduate without having a job. I targeted one company fitting too much with me. I'll try my best in the rest of this month. Hope that I'll pass interview and be a part of this company. Fighting! :blush::blush:
